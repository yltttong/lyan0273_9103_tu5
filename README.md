# 1.Imaging Technique Inspiration

Inspired by this artwork, I want to incorporate the particle elements from that work into the project and create their collision motion and interactions, to visually convey the effect of dynamic motion and a sense of movement and vigor by simulating dynamic interactions.

# 2.Coding Technique Exploration

I am planning to incorporate randomization techniques to add more variety and surprise to my project. I'll be using functions like randomSeed(), random(), and noise() to set a specific seed value and control the selection of colors, angles, sizes, and other attributes. This will guarantee that each time the code runs, it will generate distinct outcomes while remaining reproducible. Additionally, I will use random conditions in loops and random selections in arrays to enhance the visual components in my project.
